Use cases:

- ping an RSS feed every 10 seconds
- hit an API endpoint every second with random data

Easily schedule an API request in two clicks.

- hold down the control key (command on Mac) and click the *Send* button to start a timer
- wait `n` seconds
- click the *Send* button again to stop the timer
- requests will be made every `n` seconds
- click *Send* a third time to stop the requests

Here is a screencast that shows it in action.
